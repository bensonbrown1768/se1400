            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>My competitiors are all of the other bagpipers in Southern Utah. Very few bagpipers have more experience than I do. I tend to have more affordable prices than most of my competition as well. I have a very flexible schedule, unlike other bagpipers in the area.
            I also have a drummer available to play at special events for the same price.
